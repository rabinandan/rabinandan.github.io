                <h3>Neuro-Symbolic AI: Bringing a new era of Machine Learning</h3>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Processing Natural Language using machines is not a new concept. Back in 1940 researchers estimated the importance of a machine that could translate one language to another. Further, during 1957-1970 researchers split into two divisions concerning NLP: symbolic and stochastic. This paper presents an extensive review of recent breakthroughs in Neuro Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (NSAI), an area of AI research which seeks to combine traditional rules-based AI approaches with modern deep learning techniques. Neuro Symbolic models have already demonstrated the capability to outperform state-of-the-art deep learning models in domains such as image and video reasoning. Such models not only performed better when trained on a fraction of dataset compared with traditional machine learning models, but also solved an underlined issue called generalization of deep neural network systems. We also find that symbolic models are good in visual question answering (VQA). In this paper, we also review research results related to Neuro Symbolic AI with the objective of exploring the importance of such AI systems and how it would shape the future of AI as a whole. We discuss different types of dataset of Visual Question Answering(VQA) tasks based on NSAI and extensive comparison of performance of different NSAI models. Later, the article focuses on the contemporary real time application of NSAI systems and how NSAI is shaping the world’s different sectors including finance, healthcare, cyber security.</p>

                <h3>LABOR STATUS IN JAPAN AND ANALYSIS OF WMN MODEL TO PROCURE EXTERNAL HUMAN RESOURCE FROM OVERSEAS</h3>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Deficiency of labour is one of prominent issue in Japan from last several years. To handle the situation and provide the solution of this shortage of labour issue, Japanese government has set several facilities and services for employee and employer. Although there are several facilities that are helpful for people engaging in work activity in Japan, still the country faces some shorts of labour shortage. This article focusses on study of economic growth in Japan during 20th century and early of 21st century and obtains the cause of this long term 'Labour shortage issue' by analyze the past economy of Japan. Later, we have also introduced a model called 'Watasi-Mo-Nihonjin model' abbreviation is WMN model, for filling the deficiency of this labour shortage issue in future. The approach, presented in this model, is enforced by Japanese Government and Government would encourage semi-government and private bodies to join the implementation of the model for nullifying 'Labour shortage issue' throughout Japan.</p>

                <h3>Implementation of Cloud for Online Election System</h3>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The proposed paper presents the implementation of cloud for online election system. Cloud technology is becoming more popular day by day and evolving very rapidly. Firstly in the paper we discussed what cloud is, it's types and services offered. The main focus is to make feasible of online E-voting for citizen and increasing the experience of voter through online. A facial recognition system is used for security purpose and Hadoop's HDFS to implement distributed file system. And at last we talked about the advantaged of using cloud for E-voting system over others scenario.</p>
