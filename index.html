            <h4>1. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/366642431_Neuro-Symbolic_AI_Bringing_a_new_era_of_Machine_Learning">Neuro-Symbolic AI: Bringing a new era of Machine Learning</a></h4>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Processing Natural Language using machines is not a new concept. Back in 1940 researchers estimated the importance of a machine that could translate one language to another. Further, during 1957-1970 researchers split into two divisions concerning NLP: symbolic and stochastic. This paper presents an extensive review of recent breakthroughs in Neuro Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (NSAI), an area of AI research which seeks to combine traditional rules-based AI approaches with modern deep learning techniques. Neuro Symbolic models have already demonstrated the capability to outperform state-of-the-art deep learning models in domains such as image and video reasoning. Such models not only performed better when trained on a fraction of dataset compared with traditional machine learning models, but also solved an underlined issue called generalization of deep neural network systems. We also find that symbolic models are good in visual question answering (VQA). In this paper, we also review research results related to Neuro Symbolic AI with the objective of exploring the importance of such AI systems and how it would shape the future of AI as a whole. We discuss different types of dataset of Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks based on NSAI and extensive comparison of performance of different NSAI models. Later, the article focuses on the contemporary real-time application of NSAI systems and how NSAI is shaping the world’s different sectors including finance, healthcare, cyber security.</p>

            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Deficiency of labour is one of the prominent issues in Japan for the last several years. To handle the situation and provide a solution to this shortage of labour issue, the Japanese government has set several facilities and services for employees and employers. Although there are several facilities that are helpful for people engaging in work activity in Japan, the country still faces some labor shortages. This article focuses on the study of economic growth in Japan during the 20th century and early 21st century and obtains the cause of this long-term 'Labour shortage issue' by analyzing the past economy of Japan. Later, we introduced a model called 'Watasi-Mo-Nihonjin model' (abbreviated WMN model) for filling the deficiency of this labour shortage issue in the future. The approach presented in this model is enforced by the Japanese Government, encouraging semi-government and private bodies to join the implementation of the model for nullifying the 'Labour shortage issue' throughout Japan.</p>

            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The proposed paper presents the implementation of cloud for the online election system. Cloud technology is becoming more popular day by day and evolving very rapidly. Firstly, in the paper, we discussed what cloud is, its types and services offered. The main focus is to make feasible online E-voting for citizens and increasing the experience of voters online. A facial recognition system is used for security purposes and Hadoop's HDFS to implement a distributed file system. Lastly, we discussed the advantages of using cloud for E-voting systems over other scenarios.</p>
